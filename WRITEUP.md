# COMP 440 HW3 write-up

Name:

Type each answer after the `>` under its question. An answer can run over several lines, but a blank line
ends it: to start a new paragraph, put a line with just `>` between the two. In a table, fill every cell
of every numbered row. Claude may paste a program's output where a question asks for it, but never an
answer. The homework page ticks a step when every answer in its section is filled in.

## Learning goals

In this homework you will:

- Understand what makes a program an *agent*: a language model that picks the next thing to look up, reads what comes back, and decides when to stop.
- Gain hands-on experience with the loop around the model by writing it yourself: its tools, its instructions, its limit of 12 lookups, and the check that every sentence it quotes really appears in what it read.
- Compare the agent with two simpler methods on your claims, and measure how effective each one is.
- Check the agent's evidence yourself, and decide whether accuracy alone is a fair measure of it.

For extra credit, in Part 3, you find out why the agent fails on your claims, make one change, and see where Wikipedia, which is written by its volunteer editors, is thin, out of date or wrong.

# Part 0: Set up and check one claim

## 0a. Get your copy running

There is nothing to write for this step except your name, after `Name:` at the top of this file.

## 0b. Ask the model to assess a claim without tools

What verdict did the model give (*supported*, *refuted* or *doesn't say*), and what reason did it give? Quote the lines of the output that show them.

>

## 0c. Give it one search

Which Wikipedia page did it read? Quote the line of the output that shows it.

>

Did that page settle the claim correctly? If not, why do you think the search led there?

>

## 0d. Run the agent and read its trace

In one or two sentences, how did the agent get from the claim to its verdict? Point to the trace entries by their numbers.

>

Which lookup would you have done differently, and how? If none, which one surprised you?

>

# Part 1: How the agent works

## 1a. Write the loop

What does your loop send to the model on each turn? Give the line numbers in `my_loop.py`.

>

What are the ways your loop can end? Give the line number of each.

>

Now open `reference_loop.py` and compare it with your loop. Describe one difference in implementation and the resulting effects on agent behavior.

>

## 1b. Be the agent

The claim: "Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse is located at the American casino that was combined with the California Club. The casino is owned by Landry's, Inc."

List your lookups, in order. Ask Claude to paste every column but the last from `runs/part1/lookups.jsonl`. Type "Why you chose it" yourself.

| # | Tool | What you asked for | Why you chose it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | |

What is your verdict on the claim, and which sentence or sentences are most important?

>

## 1c. Watch the agent work

List the three traces you read closely. At least one should be a claim the agent got wrong (if it had errors).

| # | Claim (first few words) | Articles | Did it match the dataset's label? | Did it get there for a good reason? Why or why not |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |

Which trace did you find most interesting, and what did the agent do well or badly in it?

>

## 1d. Write the agent's instructions

What changed in the agent's traces after you wrote your instructions? Give one claim as an example.

>

## 1e. Start the full run, and predict

Predict the share of claims each version will get right (its verdict matches the dataset's label), as a percentage. A guess is fine; the reasons are what I grade.

| Version | 2 articles | 3 articles | 4 articles | Why you think so |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| No tools | | | | |
| One search | | | | |
| Agent | | | | |

How many lookups will the agent make per claim, on average? Will that grow with the number of articles? Why?

>

# Part 2: The agent against the baselines

## 2a. Compare accuracy

Ask Claude to paste the report of your full run, from `runs/part2/report.txt`, into the empty block below.

```
```

How do the results compare with your predictions? Where were you furthest off? Use the numbers from your run, by number of articles.

>

Does the gap between the agent and the one-search baseline grow with the number of articles? If it does not, what might explain that?

>

The no-tools baseline read nothing. How did it do, and what does that tell you about these claims?

>

## 2b. Check the evidence yourself

Fill in one row for each of the first five claims in your Part 2 run, in the order of the claims file, where the agent's verdict is *supported* or *refuted*.

| # | Claim (first few words) | Agent's verdict | Matched the dataset's label? | Does the quoted evidence support that verdict? | Why or why not |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |

Of the five, how many matched the dataset's label, and for how many of those does the quoted evidence support the verdict?

>

Is accuracy alone a good measure of this agent? Why or why not?

>

# Part 3 (extra credit): Why the agent fails, and one change

## 3a. Sort the failures

Fill in one row for each of the first eight failures in your full run from 1e, rows 1 to 8 of the claims table for runs/part2 with "Result" in "The agent" box set to "does not match the dataset's label (any reason)". If you have fewer than eight, fill a row for each and delete the rest. Type your labels before you ask Claude for its own. Then ask Claude to add its labels to the last column, or type them in yourself.

| Row | Claim (first few words) | Your label | The entry of the trace that shows it | Is the dataset's label right? (yes, no or can't tell) | Claude's label |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | |
| 7 | | | | | |
| 8 | | | | | |

Where did you and Claude disagree, and who do you think is right?

>

Which kind of failure was most common? If no kind repeats, say which failure you will aim at in 3b, and why.

>

## 3b. Make one change

What did you change, and why did you expect it to help?

>

How many of your evaluation claims did the agent match before the change and after it? Which of your eight failures from 3a now match?

>

Quote one claim the agent matched before the change and not after it, if there is one, and say what you think happened. If there is none, say so.

>

## 3c. Write it up

What does the agent's loop add over one search, what does it cost, and when would you not use an agent for a job like this? Use your numbers from Part 2 and Part 3.

>

What did your claims show you about Wikipedia as a source? Where it was thin or wrong, why might that be, given who writes it?

>

Your numbers rest on 100 claims. Which of your conclusions would you trust on another 100 claims, which might be chance, and what would you measure to find out?

>
